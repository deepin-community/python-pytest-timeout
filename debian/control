Description: Pytest plugin to abort hanging tests - Python 3.X
 This is a plugin which will terminate tests after a certain timeout.
 When doing so it will show a stack dump of all threads running at the
 time. This is useful when running tests under a continuous integration
 server or simply if you donâ€™t know why the test suite hangs.
 .
 Note that while by default on POSIX systems py.test will continue to
 execute the tests after a test has timed, out this is not always
 possible. Often the only sure way to interrupt a hanging test is by
 terminating the entire process. As this is a hard termination
 (os._exit()) it will result in no teardown, JUnit XML output etc. But
 the plugin will ensure you will have the debugging output on stderr
 nevertheless, which is the most important part at this stage. See below
 for detailed information on the timeout methods and their side-effects.
 .
 The pytest-timeout plugin has been tested on Python 2.6 or higher,
 including 3.X and pypy.
 .
 This package provides support for Python 3.X.
